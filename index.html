                Architecture is a collaborative process, not a solitary one.
                There is always a client and an interpreter for that client's
                demands. The client-architect relationship is critical, and the
                formation of a professional and trusted relationship between the
                two is the foundation of any successful project. Planning &
                Design conceptualization is the process of coming up with ideas
                for the best solution to a design problem. These concepts should
                be derived from the product concept and the specified
                definitions of the design problem. This is marks the initial
                phase of discussion between the architect and the client where
                ideas will be exchanged for

                The schematic drawings and elevations are evaluated, changed,
                and expanded during design development to include all of the
                features and standards required for construction. The project's
                components are scrutinized down to the slightest detail.

                Documents are frequently the most time-consuming step, which
                might surprise clients because the design appears to be complete
                after Design Development with the customer.

                When a client approaches an architect, a meeting is set up to
                discuss the needs and requirements of the project. It is
                probable that multiple meetings will be required until both
                parties are pleased with the conceptual design. However,
                designing a complete structure is a colossal task for a single
                person; architects interact with civil and structural engineers
                to discuss technical issues and the structural integrity of a
                building.

                If a preliminary presentation is unanimously approved, the
                designers can go on to the final design stages. If revisions are
                required, another meeting with revised presentations may be
                required. The following stages of the design may include a
                sequence of drawings created by professional draftsmen or by the
                interior designer himself, if he works as an independent
                contractor. Final drawings may consist of a few sheets or a
                significant number of drawings, depending on the type of task.
                Plans, elevations, details, sections, and specifications are the
                language of architectural and design offices, and they are
                prepared with meticulously drawn dimensions and comments for the
                numerous contractors who carry out the aforementioned projects.
